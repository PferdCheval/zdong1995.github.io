# 独立口语技巧总结
1. 通过预设转折增加故事吸引力——twist and ture
	eg: Although I didn’t like basketball at the beginning, after I played basketball with John for one time, I found it is really interesting and I gradually fall in love with it.
	**Although**`not ... ath the begining`, `... gradually fall in love with...`
2. 抽象feeling的具体化——`it is like...`
	对于abstract的感觉，比如冷热快乐，无法传达的时候，用it is like句型来具体化。eg：
	- My hometown is very cold in winter. It is like that you can’t feel the hand without gloves.
	- I feel so happy. It is like I just won the lottery.
	- I feel so sad. It is like I lose one friend/failed in one exam.
	- I feel so peaceful when I listen to the classic music. It is like I’m watching a baby sleeping.
3. 抽象character的实体化——举例子
	对于抽象的quality，character，可以通过实际例子来展现该特征。eg:
	- 吃货
		- even full, still will eat snacks
		- never mind the line outside the famous restaurant
		- try many restaurants when arrive in a new city, even more than the natives
	- patient
		- teaching child to solve the issue carefully
		- spend whole afternoon explaining to the elderly how to use computer
		- ❗️ fishing
	- positive
		- encourage/cheer other guys up
		- keep smiling even fail the exam
		- do volunteering doesn’t mind without any pay
4. 对现象的展开——由大及小
	对于一些名词的属性，特征，可以通过从大及小来具体化展开。eg:
	- spacious apartement
		- locate more furnitures
		- big sofa that can seat more guys
		- even can held a big party
		- have space to do indoor exercises
	- time is relaxing
		- forget the stress of homework, papers, assignment
5. 使用native的习语  

	<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
	MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath:[['$','$']]}});
	</script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
	$$习语的引入\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
	There\ is\ a\ saying+习语\\
	There\ is\ saying\ goes\ that+习语\\
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
	$$
	- All work no play makes Jack a dull boy. `只工作不娱乐人会变傻的`→**mentally tired**[^1]
	- Birds of a feather flock together. `物以类聚，人以群分`→**交友**
	- Don’t judge a book by its cover. `不要以外表判断一件事`→**交友、选严格老师还是给分松老师上课更有趣**
	- Easier said than done. `说比做容易`→**学新东西很难**
	- It’s no use crying over split milk. `覆水难收`
	- One man’s meat is another man’s position. `甲之蜜糖，乙之砒霜`→**不要强迫孩子、己所不欲勿施于人**
	- Practice makes perfect. `熟能生巧`→**speaking skills、work hard for contest**
	- Rome was not built in a day. `罗马非一日建成`→**兴趣的持久学习、assignment写作**
	- When in Rome do as the Romans do. `入乡随俗`
